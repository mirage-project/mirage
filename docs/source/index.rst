Welcome to Mirage's documentation!
====================================

Mirage is a tensor algebra superoptimizer that automatically discovers highly-optimized tensor programs for DNNs. Mirage automatically identifies and verifies sophisticated optimizations, many of which require joint optimization at the kernel, thread block, and thread levels of the GPU compute hierarchy. For an input DNN, Mirage searches the space of potential tensor programs that are functionally equivalent to the given DNN to discover highly-optimized candidates. This approach allows Mirage to find new custom kernels that outperform existing expert-designed ones.

Getting Started
